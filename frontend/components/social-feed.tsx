The journey hasn't been easyâ€”we faced countless rejections and technical hurdles along the wayâ€”but perseverance has finally paid off.\n\nLooking forward to growing our team and expanding our impact.

The principles of validated learning and build-measure-learn have transformed how I approach product development.\n\nOne lesson that particularly resonates with me is the concept of innovation accountingâ€”establishing clear metrics to measure progress when traditional accounting methods fall short. We've implemented this at our company, and it's helped us make more informed decisions about which features to prioritize and when to pivot.\n\nWhat business books have fundamentally changed your approach to entrepreneurship? Would love to expand my reading list with your recommendations!",

The panel on 'Breaking Barriers in AI Ethics' was particularly enlighteningâ€”we discussed how diverse teams are essential for developing AI systems that work fairly for everyone.\n\nI had the opportunity to present our research on using machine learning to detect biases in hiring algorithms, which sparked some fascinating discussions about responsible innovation. Many attendees were surprised by how subtle biases can be amplified through seemingly neutral systems.\n\nConnected with so many brilliant minds working at the intersection of technology and social impact. If anyone else attended, I'd love to continue our conversations!",

But staying close to our customers and solving their real problems kept us on track.\n\nKey lessons I've learned:\nâ€¢ Cash flow is king, especially when bootstrapping\nâ€¢ Hire for culture fit as much as for skills\nâ€¢ Talk to your customers every single day\nâ€¢ Focus on one core problem and solve it exceptionally well\n\nGrateful for this community's support and insights along the way. Happy to share more specific learnings if anyone's interested!",
